** existing stuff 

on private museums: 
- [[cite:&Adam_2021_rise]]
- [[cite:&Brown_2019_private]]
- [[cite:&Walker_2019_collector]]
- [[cite:&Velthuis_Gera_forthcoming_fragility]]
  elegant approach: talk about costs generally, then as a reason for closure
  cites
  - [[cite:&Walker_2019_collector, p.146]]: finance
  - [[cite:&DeNigris_2018_museums]]: no long-term strategy
  - [[cite:&Adam_2021_rise]]: founder disengagement, wrongdoing
  own finding: complex, often finance 
  -> very PM focused, also wishy-washy with "complexity"
  

density-dependence
- [[cite:Carroll_1989_density]]
- [[cite:&Carroll_1989_density_repl]]
- [[cite:&Carroll_2000_brewery]]
- [[cite:&Hannan_1992_dynamics]]: chapter 6
- [[cite:&Hannan_etal_1995_cars]]
- [[cite:&Hedstroem_1992_impasse]]: check if this gets referenced





overall argument: low density -> low legitimacy -> high closing
increasing density -> increasing legitimacy -> less closing
what is actually at high closing? [[cite:&Delacroix_Rao_1994_unbundling]]: -> competition -> high closing 


extentions of density
- [[cite:&Rao_1994_reputation]]: actual measurement of legitimation through competitions/certification/rating
- [[cite:&Zucker_1989_legitimacy]]
- [[cite:&Kennedy_2008_counted]]: sensemaking
  -> somewhat addressed in [[id:f6f23e3e-0cad-42c3-ace6-1518d4208b86][variable-driven]]
- [[cite:&Ruef_2000_emergence]]: discourse 
- [[cite:&Ruef_2004_demise]]:
  check who cites this
- [[cite:&Abrahamson_1999_fashion]]: superstitious: PMs get dropped when not providing differentiation
  # but failure to provide differentiation will be impossible to measure
- [[cite:&Dobbin_Dowd_1997_competition]]: about policy -> foundings
- [[cite:&Greve_2006_vox]]: combination of SM, ecology, production of culture
  also dealing with theory is relevant/inspiration: not actually about microradios, but theoretical contribution
- [[cite:&Greve_2002_banking]]: spatial dimension
- [[cite:&Hedstroem_1994_diffusion]]: mobilization, spatial
- [[cite:&Hsu_2005_forms]]: organizational identity/form should be measured directly (or what?), taken-for-grantedness
- [[cite:&Lizardo_2009_comparative]]: all kind of stuff of field, identity, category, logic
- [[cite:&Lomi_1995_population]]: spatial stuff, heterogeneity: not really new stuff, but expanded existing -> nice normal science
- [[cite:&Porac_1990_taxonomic]]: competitor definition
- [[cite:&Powell_1991_introduction]]: taken-for-grantedness
- [[cite:&Singh_1991_change]]: government recognition, funding -> periods change density dynamics


*should map key concepts from all articles -> sees what gaps there are*

  
  
  


*** variable-driven
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f6f23e3e-0cad-42c3-ace6-1518d4208b86
:END:

demand/legitimacy
- *inclusion in MOW/IDA*: don't have good longitudinal data tho..
- *trip advisor/social media/google reviews/media*: could link to insufficient interest from public [[cite:&Velthuis_Gera_forthcoming_fragility]]

- *organizational characteristics*
  - activities (PMDB), size, collaborations

- *founder characteristics*:
  - financial situation: performance of companies that they are board members of? -> BvD
    could also be complicated..
  - industry? I don't see how this is a good measurement.. also throwing 15 dummies in there doesn't sound great for identification
  - could do billionaire or not KEK

 - Covid restrictions


-> all things that could matter for PM, but *what's the point*? -> need more theory overall
we actually don't care about private museums...

resource-dependence

we care about wider stories/mechanisms of which private museums are an example
-> should be liberating: can choose the story, and fit PMs in there



*** use clickhouse/org-brain tags to find similar terms/papers

search terms:
- density
- ecology
- mortality


#+begin_src R
library(DBI)
library(collapse)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(RClickhouse::clickhouse(), host="localhost", db = "obvz")

cmd_bc <- "select * from bc"
cmd_bp <- "select * from bp"

## get both parent and child relations (unclear why there are separate tables, but whatever)
dt_bc <- qDT(dbGetQuery(con, cmd_bc))
dt_bp <- qDT(dbGetQuery(con, cmd_bp))

## generate brain links
dt_bl <- rbind(dt_bp[, .(child, parent)], dt_bc[, .(child, parent)]) %>% unique 
  
rel_terms1 <- .c(ecology, mortality, density)

## find papers that are good on relevant terms

## long-collapse version
sbt(dt_bl, parent %in% rel_terms1) %>% gby(child) %>% smr(cnt = len(child)) %>% sbt(cnt >= 2)

## more compact collapse
dt_rel_papers <- sbt(dt_bl, parent %in% rel_terms1) %>% fcount(child) %>% sbt(N >= 2)

## even more compact collapse possible? doubt it: different steps
## sbt(dt_bl, parent %in% rel_terms1 & fcount(parent, child) > 2)

## dt still most compact 
dt_bl[parent %in% rel_terms1, .N, child][N >= 2]

## tags they they use
dt_bl[dt_rel_papers[, .(child)], .(parent), on = "child"] %>% fcount(parent) %>% roworder(-N) %>%
  sbt(parent %!in% rel_terms1) %>% sbt(1:20)


## find papers that have similar tags to papers high on relevant terms
dt_other_papers <- dt_bl[dt_rel_papers[, .(child)], .(parent), on = "child"] %>% funique %>% 
  dt_bl[., on = "parent"] %>% .[!dt_rel_papers, on = "child"]

## tags that other papers use
dt_other_papers %>% fcount(parent) %>% roworder(-N) %>% sbt(1:20)

## print the papers with the largest absolute overlap
dt_other_papers %>% fcount(child) %>% roworder(-N) %>% sbt(1:30)

  could also look at mission statements -> atypical have higher mortality rate?

** donesies
[[file:~/Dropbox/nootes/Teece_2023_euram.org]]: dynamic capabilities -> corporate shill




*** less directly relevant
[[cite:&Walker_2010_reputation]]: reputation overall
[[cite:&Pfarrer_Pollock_Rindova_2010_assets]]: reputation on earnings surprise behavior/perception of that
[[cite:&Lange_Lee_Dai_2010_reputation]]: also lit review of reputation

[[cite:&Cavusgil_Seggie_Talay_2007_dynamic]]: dynamic capabilities
[[cite:&Strang_Soule_1998_diffusion]]: diffusion

[[cite:&Clark_2004_surge]]



** relevance
relevance of density lit: if it quacks like a duck -> if it behaves like an organizational form, it is an organizational form?
point would be that survival doesn't depend on organizational characteristics but environmental
wider relevance: are PMs really a new thing?

e.g. if there was
- no decline in mortality with higher density (which would be more legitimacy)
- less closing with better government spending, or more transformation into public
-> then PMs are not really a thing?

*(institutional) logic*: do PMs constitute a shift in logic of art provision? # like Yu's husband


is consideration of environmental characteristics contribution? to PMs maybe (although [[cite:&Velthuis_Gera_forthcoming_fragility]] have it somewhat), but not overall..
could do some cross-level interactions? -> for now seems forced, maybe makes sense later tho





** check web of science
maybe there is some annual review?
