** website classification
play a bit with NCCS data
https://urbaninstitute.github.io/nccs/datasets/core/

data:
- financial
- program and activities
- geographic information
- time series

three populations
- 501c3 Charities: 9909 + 990EZ
- 501c3 Private Foundations (990PF): all file 990PFo, regardless of size
- all other 501c Nonproifts (990 + 990EZ)

smaller NPOs file 990EZ
- PZ: all 990 + 990EZ: many orgs (400k), fewer variables (150)
- PC: all 990 filers: less orgs (200k), more variables (300)

  
five groups based on two variables:
- organizational type scope (tscope): distinguishes bewteen 501c3 public charities, 501c3 PFs, all other 501c orgs
- form filing scope (scope): which types of filers are included in dataset

organizational scope (tscope) groups: 
- private foundations: always categorized as 501(c)(3) charities, exclusively use form 990-PF, regardless of size
- other non-profits:
  - 501(c)(3) public charities: all  donations tax deductible
  - other tax exempt org types: 501(c)(1) to 501(c)(92), excluding 501(c)(3) -> labelled as 501CE-SCOPE-NONPROFIT
    501cE: everything besides 501(c)(3)

form scope
- full 990 filers: PC
- broader 990 + 990EZ filers (PZ)
# -> all PC scope are in PZ scope, but there are 990EZ filers which are not in PC scope
# there's also PF scope in filenames?
[[file:./images/screenshot-19.png]]

990N: ePostcard filers (smaller things like community associations): not included in Core Series

-> groups are:
- full 990
- 990 EZ and full 990
- only 990 EZ e
- only 990PF
- comunity foundations (full 990)

** data guide
https://nccs.urban.org/pubs/nccs-data-guide.pdf, [[file:~/Downloads/nccs-data-guide.pdf]]

NCCS processes IRS files:
- IRS Business master file (BMF): info of tex-except organizations, updated each month
- IRS return Transaction files: financial data for those organizations that file 990, 990EZ, 990-PF
  up to 60 financial variables
  produced annually by IRS
  processed by NCCS into core files
- IRS Statistics of Income Sample Files: 300 variables for organizations with 50m or more in assets
  also sample of smaller NPOs

created by NCCS  
- NCCS Cumulative Master File: mostly for locating Employer Identification Number when only name is known
  cumulative, included all dead since 1989
- NCCS Core Files: annually since 1989: descriptive from BMF, financial info from RTF
  only Form 990
  additional files for private foundations ("NCCS Core PF") and others ("NCCS Core 501(c) others")
- NCCS-GuideStar National Nonprofit Research Database (NNRD)
  cumulative listing of public charities filling Form 990 and Form 990 EZ, years 1998 to 2003
  # -> can ignore
- 1992 IRS supplements: sounds like just 1992?
  # -> can ignore
- Trends Analysis Files: time series, on request only
  # -> can ignore
- NCCS NTEE master file: classification of EIN based on NTEE

financil measures:
- pbulic support: gifts, contributions (cash, in-kind), grants
  some issues for organizations to classify gvt grants as grants or income tho
- total expenses: sum of program, fundraising, management, general expenses, payments to affiliates
- total assets
- gross receips

return year:
- year in which IRS processes form 990 -> IRS return processing year
- end of filing organiztion's fiscal year
- start year of  reporting organization's fiscal year
- central time period for the data (circa year)

*Fiscal vs. Start Years*. For example, Organization “X” has a fiscal year that begins January 1, 
2011, and ends December 31, 2012. It files its Form 990 return for that year by the May 15, 
2013, IRS deadline. The return’s Start or Tax Year and Fiscal Year are both 2012 and its 
Processing Year is 2013. The fiscal year for Organization “Y” runs from July 1, 2012, to June 
30, 2013. Its Start or Tax Year will be 2012 but its Fiscal Year and Processing Year will be 
2013.

core files and circa years: most recent return in the last three calendar years

*Care should be taken in making assumptions that organizations with missing returns no longer exist.*
-> this could inflate mortality measures hmmm


get_data seems to download only the 501CE datasets?




want:
- Core Files
- Cumulative Master File
- NTEE master file

might underestimate mortality: ded organizations   still listed as active

NTEE:
- group
- code
- orgtype




NTEE-CC: hierarchical mixed notation (letters, numbers) of
- 630 centile level codes (NTEECC?)
- 26 major groups
- 10 major categories

nada: maybe not in core?

https://urbaninstitute.github.io/nccs/catalogs/catalog-core.html: 5 types here
oof would have to download file per type and year,
and that's just core, not BMF

and then other steps will take a while too
- processing into proper OY format,
  dealing with censoring: can I include OYs that are before 1991? there I don't have the comparisons of those that closed before 1991
- assigning closing (non-filing/dropout, [[cite:&Mayer_2022_simmer]])
- matching to PMDB
- finding good comparison group: all museums, art museums, all museums except some groups, different types of charities
