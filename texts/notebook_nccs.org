play a bit with NCCS data
https://urbaninstitute.github.io/nccs/datasets/core/

data:
- financial
- program and activities
- geographic information
- time series

three populations
- 501c3 Charities: 9909 + 990EZ
- 501c3 Private Foundations (990PF): all file 990PFo, regardless of size
- all other 501c Nonproifts (990 + 990EZ)

smaller NPOs file 990EZ
- PZ: all 990 + 990EZ: many orgs (400k), fewer variables (150)
- PC: all 990 filers: less orgs (200k), more variables (300)

  
five groups based on two variables:
- organizational type scope (tscope): distinguishes bewteen 501c3 public charities, 501c3 PFs, all other 501c orgs
- form filing scope (scope): which types of filers are included in dataset

groups: 
- private foundations: always use form 990-PF, regardless of size
- other non-profits:
  - 501(c)(3) public charities: all  donations tax deductible
  - other tax exempt org types: 501(c)(1) to 501(c)(92), excluding 501(c)(3) -> labelled as 501CE-SCOPE-NONPROFIT
    501cE: everything besides 501(c)(3)

form scope
- full 990 filers
- broader 990 + 990EZ filers (PZ)

NTEE:
- group
- code
- orgtype

https://nccs.urban.org/pubs/nccs-data-guide.pdf:
NTEE-CC: hierarchical mixed notation (letters, numbers) of
- 630 centile level codes (NTEECC?)
- 26 major groups
- 10 major categories

nada: maybe not in core?

https://urbaninstitute.github.io/nccs/catalogs/catalog-core.html: 5 types here
oof would have to download file per type and year,
and that's just core, not BMF

and then other steps will take a while too
- processing into proper OY format,
  dealing with censoring: can I include OYs that are before 1991? there I don't have the comparisons of those that closed before 1991
- assigning closing (non-filing/dropout, [[cite:&Mayer_2022_simmer]])
- matching to PMDB
- finding good comparison group: all museums, art museums, all museums except some groups, different types of charities
